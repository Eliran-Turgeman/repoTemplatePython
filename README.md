# Make the template your own!

1. Change the folder name `PY_PACKAGE_NAME` to your desired package name (verify it is available as a package name on PyPI if you want to distribute it)
2. Using the same package name from 1, change the package name in `setup.py`
3. In `setup.py` modify the `author_name`, `author_email`, `description`, and `url` fields.
4. Modify the license if applicable

That's it, you can start coding now :)
